This repository contains all the examples related to a series of tutorials that demonstrate how to use the new Montoya API of Burp Suite to create extensions that will greatly simplify our pentester lives.

Each example contains the sources of the plugin, the compiled plugin and the code of the backend used for the scenario (when present in the tutorial).
